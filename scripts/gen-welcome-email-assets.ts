 * One-off generator for the welcome-email static assets.
 *
 *   ./node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts-gen-welcome-email-assets.ts
 *
 * Produces TWO objects on R2 at deterministic keys so the URLs never
 * expire (`email/` isn't in storage.ts STORAGE_KEY_PREFIXES):
 *
 *   email/welcome-hero.png   ← 1536x1024 painterly cloudscape, GPT-Image-2
 *   email/logo.png           ← mirror of public/logo.png for inline use
 *
 * The welcome-mail helper in the retired TS server (admin.ts) built URLs as
 *   `${R2_PUBLIC_BASE}/email/welcome-hero.png`
 * and embeds them in the HTML body, so re-running this script silently
 * updates the artwork everyone receives going forward (no DB write, no
 * env-var rotation, CDN cache the only thing to worry about).
 *
 * Re-run when:
 *   - you want a new hero (rare)
 *   - you change public/logo.png and want the email to match
 *
 * Pre-reqs (read from .env at repo root):
 *   OPENAI_API_KEY              — for the image-gen call
 *   R2_ENDPOINT, R2_BUCKET,
 *   R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
 *   R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
 *   R2_PUBLIC_BASE              — for the upload + URL resolution

 * Goal: an atmospheric brand banner for a software product called

 * blue + dusty wisteria purple + warm coral + cream paper. Tone is

 * Anti-goals: no characters, no UI mockups, no literal text on the
 * canvas, no harsh corporate stock-art gradients, no logos. */
const HERO_PROMPT = `A serene wide-cinematic hero illustration for a software product named Cumora — a calm place where small teams of thinkers gather.

Subject: a painterly cloudscape at the soft hour between dawn and morning. Layered cumulus clouds drift across an expansive sky in slow, sculptural formations. The horizon is barely visible, dissolving into mist. The composition has depth — distant clouds smaller and cooler, foreground clouds larger and warmer-lit — drawing the eye into the scene.

Color palette, anchor exactly:
  • brand sky blue #00A8F0 fading into pale sky #E1F3FD across the upper register
  • dusty wisteria purple #7B6CB0 transitioning to soft lilac #ECE7F5 in the mid-clouds
  • a faint warm glow of coral #FFD9D2 at the horizon, like first light catching a cloud edge
  • creamy paper #FAFCFE in the brightest highlights
Avoid neon, avoid pure saturation — every color is slightly desaturated, painterly, watercolor-soft.

Style: painterly gouache with watercolor washes, gentle volumetric light, soft volumetric edges with no hard rendering. Subtle film grain. Slight directional light from the upper right, casting long soft shadows on the underside of clouds. References: Studio Ghibli pastel skies (Castle in the Sky / Howl's Moving Castle), James Jean cloud studies, Tomer Hanuka pastel atmospherics.

Strict negative constraints: no people, no faces, no characters, no animals, no birds, no airplanes, no architecture, no buildings, no logos, no text, no letters, no UI elements, no product mockups, no screens. Pure landscape — just sky and cloud.

Mood: hopeful, welcoming, contemplative, refined. The kind of image you'd want to look at for a long time.`
