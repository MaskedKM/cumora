/**
 * One-off generator for the four starter-agent default portraits
 * (public/starter-avatars/{atlas,iris,bram,nova}.png).
 *
 * These are the four agents auto-seeded into every new company by
 * the retired TS server's onboardCompany.ts. By baking their portraits in as static
 * defaults, fresh workspaces no longer have to wait on (or pay for) an
 * image-gen call before the starter team has a face.
 *
 * The prompt + visual signature are an EXACT mirror of
 * `generateAndPersistAvatar` (retired TS api/router.ts) — same agent ids
 * feed into the same FNV-1a hash → same pools → same prompt text. If
 * later the user hits the /agents/:id/avatar/regen path on a starter,
 * they get a visually-consistent re-roll of the same character.
 *
 * Gender presentation: hardcoded here (rather than reproducing the LLM
 * classifier) so the offline run is deterministic. Values match what
 * inferAgentGender's own prompt examples specify (Atlas/Bram →
 * masculine; Iris → feminine) plus Nova → feminine (confirmed with
 * the user — gives the 4-pack 2-and-2 balance).
 *
 * Run once, commit the four PNGs:
 *
 *   node scripts/gen-starter-avatars.mjs
 *
 * Re-run only if the prompt logic or starter roster intentionally
 * changes. Don't re-run on autopilot — these images are meant to be
 * stable defaults.
