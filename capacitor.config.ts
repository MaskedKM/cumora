/**
 * Capacitor configuration for the Cumora mobile app.
 *
 * Bundle id `io.cumora.app` matches the Electron build's appId so the
 * Apple/Google portals stay aligned. `webDir` points at the web workspace's
 * build output (`apps/web/dist/`) — run `npm run build` before `npx cap sync ios`.
 *
 * `server.url` is intentionally NOT set in this checked-in config —
 * shipping with a hardcoded staging URL would lock TestFlight builds to
 * dev infra. The runtime resolveServerOrigin() in apps/web/src/api/client.ts
 * picks the API origin from VITE_CUMORA_API_BASE at build time, which
 * is the right knob for an App Store submission build.
