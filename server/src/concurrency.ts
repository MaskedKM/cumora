/**
 * Bounded-concurrency primitive — a plain counting semaphore.
 *
 * Why this exists: several hot paths fan out work with `Promise.all`
 * over an unbounded set (e.g. the scheduler waking every recipient of a
 * group message, or a fan-out path running per-recipient work
 * agent). Under a swarm / reply-storm that unbounded fan-out
 * oversubscribes shared resources — the pg connection pool (max 20),
 * the node's CPU/memory cgroup (each `kubectl` child is a ~50–100MB Go
 * binary), and the pod-admission cap (concurrent admit checks all read
 * "under cap" before any pod starts, so they all admit → overshoot).
 * That was the engine of the 2026-05-27 connection-exhaustion outage:
 * pool exhausted → triage gate times out → fails open → wakes more →
 * more load → permanent runaway that survives restarts.
 *
 * A semaphore turns that stampede into backpressure: at most `max`
 * operations run at once; the rest queue and drain at a sustainable
 * rate. Correctness is unchanged — work is delayed, never dropped.
 *
 * No external dep (we deliberately avoid p-limit/p-queue): a counting
 * semaphore is ~20 lines and trivially testable.
